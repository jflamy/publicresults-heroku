## OWLCMS Public Results Relay 4.20.2-rc03

This is the cloud version of the OWLCMS results scoreboard. It allows people anywhere on internet to see results from a competition.  

The program receives updates from the [OWLCMS](https://jflamy.github.io/owlcms4/#/index) program running at the competition site and provides scoreboards based on those updates.  In this way, the program at the competition site remains shielded from the internet, and does not have to sustain the load of many people looking at the results.

To install: click on this button.  You will be prompted to create a (free) account on the Heroku cloud if you do not have one already.  [Full instructions](https://jflamy-dev.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/Remote) for how to connect your competition site OWLCMS to the cloud relay are available [here](https://jflamy-dev.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/Remote).
